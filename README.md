# Sign-Language-Detection
**Sign Language Detection** is a Python project that leverages computer vision and machine learning to recognize hand gestures representing letters or numbers in sign language. Using OpenCV for real-time webcam input and trained models for gesture classification, it helps bridge communication gaps and aids in sign language interpretation.
